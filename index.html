		<p>I'm a first year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">Institute for Natural Language Processing</a>, University of Stuttgart.</p>
		<p>I'm part of the research group <a href="https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/researchgroups/mist/">Computational Models of Misunderstanding for Complex Instructional Texts (MisT)</a> 
		supervised by <a href="https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Roth-00006/">Dr. Michael Roth</a>.</p>
		<p>I'm working on natural language processing (NLP). My research goal is to <b>model the potential for conflicting interpretations in written texts</b>.</p>
		<p>My research interests include<p>
		 <ul>
  			<li>ambiguity, of the intentional and the unintentional kind</li>
  			<li>text structure, coherence and cohesion</li>
  			<li>the difference between implicit and explicit meaning</li>
			<li>relation extraction and knowledge graphs</li>
			<li>few-shot learning, knowledge distillation and other fun ways of thinking about resource efficiency in machine learning</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>By the way, if you are wondering why a üçã pops up every now and then on this page, my last name "Sauer" (/Ààza äÃØ…ê/) means "sour" or "acid" in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sauer#German">German</a>.</p>
